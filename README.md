# R Utilities

This package bundles up a collection of R tools for data science
and other analysis, including utility functions, PDF templates,
and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) themes. Some of
these I've dreamed up or needed at
[work](https://www.elderresearch.com/).

## Installation

I don't really intend to ever put this onto CRAN, but it's easily
installed using the [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org) package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tomshafer/tt")
```
